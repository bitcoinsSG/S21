# Rules for the channel:

### Etiquette and Ethos
1. Conversations and posts MUST be clearly about cryptocurrencies, decentralization, blockchain technology or immediately relevant topics.

2. Our focus is on the PEOPLE that can meet in real life at our meetups. The S21 community is about human contact, experience, and networking. Non human entities (i.e. bots) will have to go through a strenuous selection process; contact an admin about any prospective inclusions.

3. Be kind, don't be rude (passionate debates are fine, but no ad hominem attacks).

4. Special cases for removal or censorship not covered by above will be considered on a case by case basis by the admins.

### Marketing
5. Any advertising of events must by submitted to channel moderator or admin for approval before posting on main channel. S21 will share the events weekly on the main channel and/or in real-time on a separate channel. Paid event(s) must offer special benefits to S21 members like a few free tickets, discounts, early access or similar.
