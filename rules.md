### Etiquette and Ethos
The S21 community is dedicated to individuals passionate about decentralization, blockchain technology, free speech, and technologies that empower the masses. We provide a safe space to express opinions, particularly if they contribute positively to the broader community.

Like Satoshi, the inspiration behind our name, S21 (Satoshi's 21, reflecting Satoshi's moral choices), our values emphasize openness/permissionless innovation, democratization, selflessness, and Socratic discussions.

### Rules
1. Conversations and posts MUST focus on decentralized technologies, including timechains/blockchains, web3, cryptography, and directly related topics.

2. Maintain kindness and civility. Avoid ad hominems (passionate debates are encouraged, but refrain from personal attacks).

3. Special cases for content removal or censorship not covered by the above, will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis by appointed community managers and representatives. Creating a foolproof rule set that is also easy to understand is challenging.

### Marketing
4. This platform is a safe space to share your passions, particularly when they contribute to the larger community. While we regard marketing as an aspect of free speech, be ready to engage in discussions about your post. We advise limiting yourself to one post per event, especially if you have a vested interest in its success. While not a strict rule, anticipate some criticism if you promote your event without offering freebies or benefits to the S21 community.

## Disclosure by the Author:

While my primary goal is to maximize free speech, I acknowledge the irony of doing so from a platform with an authoritarian command structure. As the "owner" of the Telegram group, I am a central point of failure, and there is the additional authoritarian structure and central points of failure within Telegram the company. I am working on creating decentralized alternatives, like a Nostr account for S21. Theoretically, this should be more challenging to shut down, censor, or control. However, for now, I intend to keep it as a backup plan/escape route.
