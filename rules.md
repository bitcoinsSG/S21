# Rules for the channel:

### Etiquette and Ethos
1. Conversations and posts MUST be clearly about cryptocurrencies, decentralization, blockchain technology or immediately relevant topics.

2. Our focus is on the PEOPLE that can meet in real life at our meetups. The S21 community is about human contact, experience, and networking. Non human entities (i.e. bots) will have to go through a strenuous selection process; contact an admin about any prospective inclusions.

3. Be kind, don't be rude (passionate debates are fine, but no ad hominem attacks).

4. Special cases for removal or censorship not covered by above will be considered on a case by case basis by the admins.

### Marketing
5. Any advertising of a paid event(s) must be approved by the admins first and must offer special benefits to S21 members like a few free tickets, discounts, early access or something similar.
